NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'test' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. On the control server, display the ansible version and status and issue an ansible command to list all configured hosts.
2. Choosing ONE of the groups from the displayed list in Step #1 above, query that system for all the 'facts' that can be displayed, while filtering the content for the IP address information.
3. Using the same group from Steps #1 and #2, issue a shell command through ansible that will determine if the 'lynx' package is already installed on that server.
4. Using the same group, issue an ansible command (as sudo) that will display the last ten lines of output from the remote system's 'syslog' file.

 On the control server, display the ansible version and status and issue an ansible command to list all configured hosts.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
2. Choosing ONE of the groups from the displayed list in Step #1 above, query that system for all the 'facts' that can be displayed, while filtering the content for the IP address information.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible apacheweb -m setup -a 'filter=ans*ipv4*'
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success >> {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "172.31.108.45"
        ],
        "ansible_default_ipv4": {
            "address": "172.31.108.45",
            "alias": "eth0",
            "gateway": "172.31.96.1",
            "interface": "eth0",
            "macaddress": "12:29:fb:d6:9a:af",
            "mtu": 9001,
            "netmask": "255.255.240.0",
            "network": "172.31.96.0",
            "type": "ether"
        }
    },
    "changed": false
}
 
3. Using the same group from Steps #1 and #2, issue a shell command through ansible that will determine if the 'lynx' package is already installed on that server.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible apacheweb -m shell -a 'yum list installed | grep lynx'
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success | rc=0 >>
lynx.x86_64                           2.8.8-0.3.dev15.el7              @base
 
4. Using the same group, issue an ansible command (as sudo) that will display the last ten lines of output from the remote system's 'syslog' file.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible apacheweb -m shell -a 'tail -n 10 /var/log/dmesg'
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success | rc=0 >>
