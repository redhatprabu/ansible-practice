NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'user' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
3. Create an outline for a playbook that lists the following (name it 'webserver.txt'):
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to web servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Indicate to capture a pre-task timestamp
- Install the apache web server, telnet client and lynx web browser
- Capture a log of all installed packages on the system
- Indicate to capture a post-task timestamp



Solution : 


1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
 
3. Create an outline for a playbook that lists the following (name it 'webserver.txt'):
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to web servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Indicate to capture a pre-task timestamp
- Install the apache web server, telnet client and lynx web browser
- Capture a log of all installed packages on the system
- Indicate to capture a post-task timestamp
[test@tcox3 Outline]$ vim webserver.txt 
[test@tcox3 Outline]$ cat webserver.txt 
- webservers
- test user
- sudo rights

- date/time stamp for when the playbook start

- install the apache web server
- start the web service

- verify that the web service is running

- install client software
  - telnet
  - lynx

- log all the packages install on the system

- date/time stamp for when the playbook ends
