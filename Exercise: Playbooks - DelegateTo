NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'user' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
3. Create a playbook, using the 'DELEGATE TO' concepts from the video:
- Uses local connection
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to the localhost
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Installs the 'Telnet Client' using the appropriate package module
4. Run the playbook and display the results.



Solution : 


1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create a playbook, using the 'DELEGATE TO' concepts from the video:
- Uses local connection
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to the localhost
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Installs the 'Telnet Client' using the appropriate package module
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim local.yml 
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat local.yml 
--- # LOCAL ACTION PLAYBOOK
- hosts: 127.0.0.1
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: Install Telnet Client
      yum: pkg=telnet state=latest
 
4. Run the playbook and display the results.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook local.yml
