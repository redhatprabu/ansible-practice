NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'test' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup).
1. Run the appropriate ansible command to list all the hosts that are configured on your system for access by the control server. Display the ansible 'hosts' file in active use on the control server so that the hosts and groups are displayed.
2. Edit the previously created 'myfirstplaybook.yml' file from our previous exercises. Create a task section that uses the 'yum' module to install the apache web server on the host(s) indicated in the playbook. Display the file after editing.
3. Run the playbook, after the initial installation of apache, run the playbook a second time to note the differing output.
4. Add another task to the playbook that uses the 'yum' module to check and see if the 'lynx' package is installed and then display that file.
5. Run the playbook and display the results.




Solution : 


1. Run the appropriate ansible command to list all the hosts that are configured on your system for access by the control server. Display the ansible 'hosts' file in active use on the control server so that the hosts and groups are displayed.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
[test@tcox3 ~]$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
[local]
localhost
[apacheweb]
tcox4.mylabserver.com
[appserver]
tcox5.mylabserver.com
 
2. Edit the previously created 'myfirstplaybook.yml' file from our previous exercises. Create a task section that uses the 'yum' module to install the apache web server on the host(s) indicated in the playbook. Display the file after editing.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim myfirstplaybook.yml
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat myfirstplaybook.yml
--- # My First YAML Playbook for Ansible
- hosts: apacheweb
  user: test
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    playbook_version: 0.1b
  vars_files:
    - conf/copyright.yml
    - conf/webdefaults.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache Web Server
      action: yum name=httpd state=installed
 
3. Run the playbook, after the initial installation of apache, run the playbook a second time to note the differing output.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook myfirstplaybook.yml
 
PLAY [apacheweb] **************************************************************
 
TASK: [Install Apache Web Server] *********************************************
changed: [tcox4.mylabserver.com]
 
PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
tcox4.mylabserver.com      : ok=1    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
 
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook myfirstplaybook.yml
 
PLAY [apacheweb] **************************************************************

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
tcox4.mylabserver.com      : ok=1    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
 
4. Add another task to the playbook that uses the 'yum' module to check and see if the 'lynx' package is installed and then display that file.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim myfirstplaybook.yml
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat myfirstplaybook.yml
--- # My First YAML Playbook for Ansible
- hosts: apacheweb
  user: test
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    playbook_version: 0.1b
  vars_files:
    - conf/copyright.yml
    - conf/webdefaults.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache Web Server
      action: yum name=httpd state=installed
    - name: Verify the Lynx Web Browser
      action: yum name=lynx state=present
 
5. Run the playbook and display the results.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook myfirstplaybook.yml
 
PLAY [apacheweb] **************************************************************
 
TASK: [Install Apache Web Server] *********************************************
ok: [tcox4.mylabserver.com]
 
TASK: [Verify the Lynx Web Browser] *******************************************

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
tcox4.mylabserver.com      : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
