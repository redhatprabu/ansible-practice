NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'user' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
3. Create a playbook, using the 'PROMPT' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to ALL servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Creates a local variable called 'playbook_version' and assigns some value
- Prompts the playbook user for a package to install, defaulting to the telnet package if nothing is entered. This command should echo the typed output to the console.
4. Run the playbook and display the results.



Solution : 




1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create a playbook, using the 'PROMPT' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to ALL servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Creates a local variable called 'playbook_version' and assigns some value
- Prompts the playbook user for a package to install, defaulting to the telnet package if nothing is entered. This command should echo the typed output to the console.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim prompt.yml
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat prompt.yml
--- # PROMPT FOR USER PACKAGE EXAMPLE
- hosts: apacheweb
  user: test
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    playbook_version: 0.01b
  vars_prompt:
    - name: pkgtoinstall
      prompt: Install Which Package?
      default: telnet
      private: no
  tasks:
    - name: Install the indicated package
      yum: pkg={{ pkgtoinstall }} state=latest
 
 
4. Run the playbook and display the results.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook prompt.yml
Install Which Package? [telnet]: lynx
