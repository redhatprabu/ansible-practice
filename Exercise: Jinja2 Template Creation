    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create an abitrary configuration file called test.conf.j2 that contains:

- reference to one variable that can be gathered when remote facts are obtained
- Display the result.
[test@tcox3 files]$ vim test.conf.j2
[test@tcox3 files]$ cat test.conf.j2
