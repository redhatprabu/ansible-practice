NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'user' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
3. Create a playbook, using the 'RUN ONCE' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to ALL servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Runs the remote 'uptime' command and logs it to the remote /home/test directory in a file called 'uptime.log'
- List the remote /var directory and pipe the output to the /home/test directory in a file called 'dir.list'
- Indicate that the directory listing command should only be run ONCE on the first host and not again
4. Run the playbook and display the results.



Solution : 



1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create a playbook, using the 'RUN ONCE' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to ALL servers
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Runs the remote 'uptime' command and logs it to the remote /home/test directory in a file called 'uptime.log'
- List the remote /var directory and pipe the output to the /home/test directory in a file called 'dir.list'
- Indicate that the directory listing command should only be run ONCE on the first host and not again
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim runonce.yml 
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat runonce.yml 
--- # RUNONCE PLAYBOOK EXAMPLE
- hosts: all
  user: test
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Run the uptime command on all hosts and log it
      raw: /usr/bin/uptime >> /home/test/uptime.log
    - name: List the /var directory and log it
      raw: ls -al /var >> /home/test/dir.list
      run_once: true
4. Run the playbook and display the results.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook runonce.yml
