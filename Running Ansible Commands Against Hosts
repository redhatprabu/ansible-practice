NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'test' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Display the current version and status of the Ansible application.
2. Using the appropriate module, from your control server, list all the hosts configured in your environment. Using ansible, run a ping command against all hosts in the environment.
3. List the contents of your ansible 'hosts' file. Using only ONE of the groups in the file, attempt to install the 'lynx' package on that server.
4. Using the same group as Step #3, attempt to install the 'telnet' package on that server using the more 'playbook friendly' module and syntax.

 NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'test' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Display the current version and status of the Ansible application.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Using the appropriate module, from your control server, list all the hosts configured in your environment. Using ansible, run a ping command against all hosts in the environment.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all -m ping
localhost | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
 
tcox5.mylabserver.com | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
 
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
 
3. List the contents of your ansible 'hosts' file. Using only ONE of the groups in the file, attempt to install the 'lynx' package on that server.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
[local]
localhost
 
[apacheweb]
tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
[appserver]
tcox5.mylabserver.com
 
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible apacheweb -s -m shell -a 'yum -y install lynx'
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success | rc=0 >>

Package lynx-2.8.8-0.3.dev15.el7.x86_64 already installed and latest version
Nothing to do
 
4. Using the same group as Step #3, attempt to install the 'telnet' package on that server using the more 'playbook friendly' module and syntax.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible apacheweb -s -m yum -a 'pkg=telnet state=installed update_cache=true'
tcox4.mylabserver.com | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "",
    "rc": 0,
    "results": [
        "telnet-0.17-59.el7.x86_64 providing telnet is already installed"
    ]
}
