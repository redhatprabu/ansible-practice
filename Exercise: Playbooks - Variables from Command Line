NOTE: These exercises can be completed on Linux Academy Lab Servers with any distribution and version available AS LONG AS the Ansible application has been installed and the 'user' user has been set up with SSH Key Exchange for password less SSH sessions (see previous lab for setup). 
1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
3. Create a playbook, using the 'Variables from Command Line' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as a VARIABLE user
- Connects to one server or group passed in as a VARIABLE
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Installs a package passed in as a VARIABLE
4. Run the playbook and display the results.



Solution : 


1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create a playbook, using the 'Variables from Command Line' concepts from the video:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as a VARIABLE user
- Connects to one server or group passed in as a VARIABLE
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Installs a package passed in as a VARIABLE
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim fromcmdline.yml
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat fromcmdline.yml
--- # VARIABLES AT A COMMAND LINE PASSING EXAMPLE
- hosts: '{{ hosts }}'
  user: '{{ user }}'
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: Install some software
    yum: pkg={{ pkg }} state=latest
 
 
4. Run the playbook and display the results
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook fromcmdline.yml --extra-vars "hosts=apacheweb user=test pkg=telnet"
